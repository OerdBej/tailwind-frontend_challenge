# Tailwind Landing Page

Welcome to the Tailwind Landing Page project! This project is a challenge I took on Frontend Mentor to replicate a design using Tailwind CSS. The purpose of this challenge was to enhance my understanding of Tailwind CSS and further develop my frontend skills.

The goal of this project is to create a fully responsive and functional landing page that closely matches the provided design. The focus of this challenge is primarily on HTML and CSS, with the utilization of Tailwind CSS as the primary framework. Although there is a small inclusion of JavaScript for the mobile navigation toggle, it is optional and can be omitted if desired.

Feel free to utilize any tools or frameworks or to copy the code.

## Project Requirements

By the end of this project, your landing page should meet the following criteria:

-   Responsiveness: The page should adapt to different screen sizes, providing an optimal layout for users on various devices.
-   Interactive Elements: Ensure that all interactive elements on the page have hover states, enhancing the user experience.

Feel free to explore and modify the codebase as needed to achieve the desired outcome. Remember, the goal is to create a landing page that closely resembles the provided design.
